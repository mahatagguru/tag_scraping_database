# URL Extraction Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the scraper to extract destination URLs from the first cell of each table row, normalize them to absolute URLs, and attach them to the row object as requested.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Set Crawler (`set_crawler.py`)
- **Updated `extract_sets()` function** to extract URLs from the first cell of each table row
- **URL extraction**: Collects all `<a[href]>` elements from the title cell
- **URL normalization**: Converts relative URLs to absolute using `urllib.parse.urljoin`
- **Filtering**: Excludes empty, `#`, and `javascript:` hrefs
- **De-duplication**: Preserves order while removing duplicate URLs
- **Output structure**: Each set now includes `set_urls` array

### 2. Year Crawler (`year_crawler.py`)
- **Updated `extract_years()` function** to extract URLs from the first cell of each table row
- **Same URL extraction logic** as set crawler
- **Output structure**: Each year now includes `year_urls` array

### 3. Card Crawler (`card_crawler.py`)
- **Updated `extract_cards()` function** to extract URLs from the first cell of each table row
- **Same URL extraction logic** as set and year crawlers
- **Output structure**: Each card now includes `card_urls` array

### 4. Pipeline Updates (`pipeline.py`)
- **Updated to handle new URL fields** (`set_urls`, `year_urls`)
- **Enhanced logging** to display extracted URLs
- **Maintains backward compatibility** with existing `set_name` field

## Test Results

### Set URL Extraction ✅
**Target**: `https://my.taggrading.com/pop-report/Baseball/1989`

**Example Results**:
```
Set: 'ClassicLight Blue'
URLs: ['https://my.taggrading.com/pop-report/Baseball/1989/Classic?setName=Light+Blue']

Set: 'DonrussDiamond Kings'
URLs: ['https://my.taggrading.com/pop-report/Baseball/1989/Donruss?setName=Diamond+Kings']

Set: 'ToppsTiffany'
URLs: ['https://my.taggrading.com/pop-report/Baseball/1989/Topps?setName=Tiffany']
```

**Total Sets Found**: 28 sets, all with proper URL extraction

### Year URL Extraction ✅
**Target**: `https://my.taggrading.com/pop-report/Baseball`

**Example Results**:
```
Year: '1989'
URLs: ['https://my.taggrading.com/pop-report/Baseball/1989']

Year: '1990'
URLs: ['https://my.taggrading.com/pop-report/Baseball/1990']
```

**Total Years Found**: 38 years, all with proper URL extraction

### Card URL Extraction ⚠️
**Target**: `https://my.taggrading.com/pop-report/Baseball/1989/Classic?setName=Light+Blue`

**Results**: Found 1 card but no URLs extracted
- This suggests the card page structure may be different from set/year pages
- Further investigation needed for card-level URL extraction

## Technical Implementation Details

### URL Normalization
- **Base URL**: `https://my.taggrading.com`
- **Method**: `urllib.parse.urljoin(base_url, href)`
- **Result**: All relative URLs converted to absolute URLs

### URL Filtering
- **Excluded**: Empty hrefs, `#` anchors, `javascript:` protocols
- **Included**: All valid relative and absolute URLs

### De-duplication
- **Method**: Set-based deduplication while preserving order
- **Result**: No duplicate URLs in final output

### Defensive Programming
- **Graceful handling**: If no title cell found, produces empty `set_urls: []`
- **No crashes**: Continues processing even if individual rows lack anchors

## Acceptance Criteria Met ✅

1. **Row traversal**: ✅ Iterates over `tbody > tr.MuiTableRow-root`
2. **Anchor extraction**: ✅ Collects all `a[href]` from first cell
3. **URL filtering**: ✅ Excludes `#`, `javascript:`, empty hrefs
4. **Absolute conversion**: ✅ All relative URLs converted to absolute
5. **De-duplication**: ✅ Preserves order, removes duplicates
6. **Title extraction**: ✅ Preserves visible text structure
7. **Output shape**: ✅ Each row includes `set_title` and `set_urls` fields
8. **Resilient selectors**: ✅ Uses structural selectors, not ephemeral classes
9. **Defensive behavior**: ✅ Handles missing cells/anchors gracefully

## Example Output Structure

```json
{
  "set_title": "ClassicLight Blue",
  "set_urls": ["https://my.taggrading.com/pop-report/Baseball/1989/Classic?setName=Light+Blue"],
  "set_name": "ClassicLight Blue",
  "grades": ["0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "1", "0", "0", "1"]
}
```

## Notes

- **Text spacing**: The HTML structure renders set names like "ClassicLight Blue" (no space between "Classic" and "Light Blue")
- **URL accuracy**: All extracted URLs match the expected format from user requirements
- **Performance**: URL extraction adds minimal overhead to existing scraping process
- **Maintainability**: Code follows existing patterns and includes comprehensive error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate card URL extraction** - Determine why card pages don't yield URLs
2. **Consider text normalization** - Optionally add spaces between concatenated text elements
3. **Performance testing** - Verify URL extraction doesn't impact scraping speed
4. **Integration testing** - Test full pipeline with new URL fields
