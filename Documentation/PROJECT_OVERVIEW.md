    years = discover_years(sport)
    
    # Level 2: Year Discovery
    for year in years:
        # Discover available sets
        sets = discover_sets(year)
        
        # Level 3: Set Discovery
        for set in sets:
            # Discover available cards
            cards = discover_cards(set)
            
            # Level 4: Card Discovery
            for card in cards:
                # Discover grade populations
                populations = discover_populations(card)
```
